"1st off - I knew right away I wouldn’t be staying at this property again. Right after check in, we go to self park, only to find out that we weren’t given a code for the gate. Go up to Valet, get the code, go get in our room. Mind you, self parking and our room were on COMPLETELY opposite sides of the hotel property. Next, I realize I was charged for parking and forgot to mention that we had a handicap tag. I call the front desk, explain, and get told that I would get a refund to the card I put on file. Sounds great, problem solved. Next day, hadn’t received any notification for the refund and ALSO got a notice on our car that it was going to get towed because I didn’t have a parking tag on the dash.....when I wasn’t given anything by the front desk. I go talk to the front desk after our morning at the park & they say that they do charge for handicap and end up giving me a parking tag. Overall, it was not worth even the small cost of the stay.

"The property is in a nice neighborhood with restaurants, retail shopping and easy access to public transportation. The facility was only about twenty minutes from LaGuardia airport which was convenient after a long day of travel. The hotel was clean and check in was easy with the staff. They ran out of room card so we only had one during our stay which was fine because we were together coming and going. They did tell us to check back in the morning after our check in but we didn’t check back.   We had a king size bed in our room which was very comfortable. The bathroom was small as you had to wedge yourself in the corner to shut or open the door but the shower was nice and the sink area as well. The mirror also lit up without the main light as well which was a nice feature.   Nice flat screen tv mounted on the wall and a wardrobe provided because there wasn’t a closet. We made use of a corner in the room for our large luggage and had plenty of cubby holes for clothing and shoes.   Breakfast was also provided every morning which was a great way to start the day not having to worry about food for a good part of the day. The only negative was that it was the same foods everyday in a buffet style.   Overall for the price, room features, neighborhood location and breakfast I would stay here again.

The Wyndham has gone back. The room was awful. The toilet kept breaking and on the last day they decided to turn off the water mid way through a shower without notifying the guests. In addition a cockroach was also seen in the bath tub. Around the pool it’s pretty much look after yourself. There is no one coming round taking drink orders and there is no amenity to blow up your child’s floaty. The surface of the pool is in need of some TLC. I have stayed here so many times but this will be my last time as the hotel has seriously gone back.

I returned to the front desk and the night manager was there and he upgraded us to the tower, ok that's fine. We get to the 10th floor tried the key, it didn't work. So I had to drag my kids and wife back down to the lobby. This time he gave us a room key that worked but we still didn't know where bags were. The night manager was awesome.

"I really liked this hotel and will probably book there again. Amenities are awesome, overall hotel is very nice, the reason i reviewed as i did was because when we arrived, the hotel staff told us that they overbooked and we were going to have to be moved from room to room in the middle of our stay. With children, that sucks. But we didn’t have a choice. We booked so long in advance there was no way another hotel would be the same price and the area was pretty sold out. So we bit the bullet. BUT the next morning we went downstairs and the staff at the counter had no idea what we were talking about, then informed us that there were no other rooms to move us to, which is great! It was just an inconvenience we had to stay packed for a day thinking we’d be moving rooms and then when addressed no one knew what we were talking about. Also, breakfast at the Summit restaurant in the same parking lot. We got the continental and it was just fruit and a fruit pastry. I paid for a different breakfast but it was ridiculously priced. If we weren’t staying at the hotel, two bowls of fruit, two pastries, two plates of biscuits and gravy would have been $65!!! Luckily it was not that much since we were staying there.

"I stayed here with my girlfriend for her birthday. Prior to my stay I messaged the hotel about any additions for the birthday that if they added I would pay for in advance and appreciate. None of that happened. Upon check in the front desk woman was coarse and seemed overworked. I had questions about the amenities and she quickly averted the topic. The bartenders in the lobby were nice but it seemed that everyone was from another country(that’s all they talked about). That’s fine with me but it became noticably worse when they were arriving to work visibly hung over.   The “resort” is fine. At check in we were handed a map that let us know where everything was. There was a quiet pool On that map that we were looking forward to, however the reality is that it was unmonitored and often over run by kids and louder adults. The same with the hot tub. There is no spa here despite what is advertised. There is a small gym open to anyone and a sauna - and during our stay there were kids everywhere so we didn’t bother to use these features. Also - there are ducks on the property. For me and my girl we enjoyed them and know that in Florida wildlife comes with staying anywhere.

Dont bother ordering room service and if your a soda drinker, BRING YOUR OWN!!! last night i ordered a meal to split between myself and my young daughter. I splurged a bit and got the steak and potatoes. They asked what drink we wanted. I ordered a pepsi and a sprite. To my surprise, a CAN NOT BOTTLE was $5.00 A PIECE! Which meant $10.00 for two cans of soda... TALK ABOUT ROBBERY. The steak I ordered was $32, but once the cokes were added plus 18% for them walking it up, our bill for one plated meal was $61.00. >< The bus transport they offer to the parks is ridiculous and the drivers are rude(even to children) and they are always late. They also leave when people are walking/running up flagging them down to wait. (Saw this on multiple occasions during our three day stay)  Nothing in this hotel is disney themed other than the ""store"" down stairs. Oh! And the fees to stay here are outrageous. $25 a night resort fee, but you also HAVE to pay $20 a day to park your car, even if you park it. So for three nights, we had to pay, $75 in resort fees and $60 to park our car. $135 on top of what we paid for the room which was a little over $350 bucks.

"We were only comfortable 1 of the 7 nights we stayed in this hotel. I rented two rooms, both were changed day 3 due to cold showers the prior two nights.

Another cold shower, and left in the morning. When we returned, the bed had water on it dripping from the air conditioner vent and the AC was not working correctly. Since it couldn’t be fixed, all furniture was moved to the side out of the drip area which meant I couldn’t sit on the bed without hitting my head on a light, and no AC for that evening. The next day they lied again saying it had been fixed. I had to call for them to move the furniture back and then looked up to see more water on the vent. We pushed the furniture over ourselves and slept like that the rest of our stay, without the AC working properly. After talking to every single manager and getting nowhere I had to wait two hours one morning day 6 to speak to the director of operations who all but accused me of lying because why would he “take a customers word over his employees?” He took 6 days off of one of my rooms.

"After staying here several times during the past six years, this was likely our final stay. The location is excellent, it's about a five minute walk to Disney Springs. The pool is great and has a section that's wonderful for kids. The food at the pool, although a little pricey, is pretty good. Both the park shuttles and beds were great.  However, the last two times we have stayed the housekeeping has been less than ideal. I gave them the benefit of the doubt last time and thought maybe we had the same housekeeper every time and they were just having some bad days but it happened this trip too. The tile floors were not cleaned during our stay and we had two people with long hair. The tub did not seem to get cleaned because a rusty stain started appearing from the dripping however I think they did try because two days when we came back for the evening, the tub was plugged and water was standing in it. We had the garden view on our other trips and this time we were stuck in the back by the employee parking. We missed the view but thought maybe it would be quieter since less people were walking past, etc. But the car alarms all night made up for it. The hotel room wasn't showing too much wear other than the tub definitely needed to be refinished as there were several peeling spots.  I have recommended this hotel to many people due to our previous experiences however this trip was disappointing and for a small amount more, next time will stay on property.

"Overall, it was a very nice resort. This trip was a surprise for my daughter's 17th birthday and I would like to give a special thanks to Deborah and Ali at Tesoro Cove who brought her out a cupcake and sang happy birthday to her ! She really loved it and nothing really phases her (not even the surprise trip) !  .....I feel like there should have been a shuttle bus to Universal Studios from the resort as well as to Disney. The shuttle buses eliminate the costly expense of parking. .....I ordered room service two of the nights that we stayed and I was under the impression the charges were take from my account at the time the food was delivered but when I checked out, I was given the bill for room service and other charges. I was not given the option of having it debited from credit card and I would have preferred that to having more charges added to my already expensive bill. Maybe I misunderstood but I thought when I booked the trip through Expedia that everything except resort fees were paid for but when I checked in I was charged another $300 which was refunded but I was not prepared for that, I could have budgeted a little better for the trip.  Nevertheless, it was taken care of. My next trip will be a planned a little better and I will stay somewhere a little less expensive and somewhere that provides transportation to more places.

"Arrived at 11:30am last Saturday and was told check-in was at 4pm. (There was also a group of over 100 loud girls in the lobby so this was a tad annoying.) OK. At 3:55, we went to the front desk and the room was still not ready. First red flag. There was another family ahead of us who seemed to have the same issue and they arrived at noon. I went back in line after 4PM and again, room wasn't ready. It was at this point that I ""asked to speak to the manager"" 20 minute wait and no manger came out but the front desk all of a sudden had a room ready for us. We went to the room and wow, the madness continues. There were bugs in the room, the toilet wouldn't flush, the safe was not working and the hotel room looked like a dump. It didn't look like what I had reserved. I called front desk to speak to the manager and we switched our room to another one and was told that there were two buildings for the hotel and we were in the one I did not request. We were told we could switch to tower next day at no extra cost.The next day, we go to Epcot and come back to pick up our rooms keys. 9th floor in the tower.

"First, let me start off by saying that I have NEVER liked this cheap looking hotel. I was there in 2003, and my keycard kept deactivating on its own. Now, in 2019, it did it again. I see you haven't upgraded. But this is not about the keycard. This is about your silly ""Facility Fee."" Exactly, WHAT FACILITIES did I use??? The toilet? I was under the impression that that was covered in the regular hotel fee! We got no complimentary coffee. No hair dryer in our room. No complimentary breakfast in the lobby either. So what did my facility fee cover? That was never explained. The only thing we ""used"" was the bed, bathroom and tv, which comes with any hotel room, and should be included in the price of the hotel. Those shouldn't be considered as, ""extras"" or ""facility fees."" Moreover, Expedia advertises this scummy hotel as having free WIFI. Hmmm. So if that's part of the facility fee, then it's NOT FREE! I've been to NY LOTS of times. No hotel has ever charged this ridiculous fee! It's like, you charged me twice for the same room. The only reason I picked this hotel, was because with the Pride festivities going on, everything was booked, or the prices were higher than usual. This hotel was advertised as $101/night on Expedia. My brother paid for me and his daughter (my niece) to stay there for 2-nights. The price was $268 total. That should've covered everything that comes with the hotel!

"Very disappointing stay. The property is clearly poorly managed by a Chinese. Manager and this is evident in every respect. Examples: when arrived my 2 beds room was not available since the property manager had “guests” in the hotel not registered that had taken my room (and another); I was given my key and when I eneterd my room it was occupied and this is how the unregistered guest were discovered .... I was changed into 2 room (disappointing as I was with my kids). The new room had dirty bedsheets, no toilet paper and door lock not functioning (not nice given that somebody maybe issued a key for an occupied roon as it happend to me). The next day when I returned to the room the room was not done.... I called and the reception required me to go down and get keys for another room.. I was extremely disappointed to be forced to change again the room.... but there was no way to stay in my room sunce they would not make it therefore me and my kids had to move to another room (this time 2 beds)...

Do not valet your vehicle at this property! I made the mistake of allowing them to valet my mustang only to watch from my room on the 18th floor as two teenagers drove it around the parking lot at over 30 mph and then proceeded to sit in my car for over 5 min. When I confronted them they claimed they couldn’t speak English and didn’t know who it was that parked my car. Don’t trust them!!!! Also check in was way too long! Took over 20 min to check in and then they make you go to a separate counter where they high pressure you into taking a tour of their vacation club. It took us another 10 min to get away from them and get the key to our room finally. If you refuse to talk to them they will not give you a code for parking.  No parking in self parking at all! Very crowded. The pools were dirty and smelled of high chlorine levels. My daughters eyes were swollen and red after only 10 min of swimming. No water pressure in the bathroom.

"The first thing we did not like was that the man who checked us in acted like we were his least favorite people even though we had never met and I greeted him normally. Secondly, he told us we had a second floor room and we had 5 pieces of luggage - one of them extremely heavy. I asked where the elevator was and he said there wasn't one. He showed us a map of where the room was and wished us a good night. We would never have found the room and we would have had to hump all those bags upstairs by ourselves if the van driver had not come and helped us. Big thumbs down to the desk clerk - he might have offered us a ground floor room. Secondly, there was no way to turn on a light in the room when we got there. No wall switches or card swipes - had to walk into a dark room and feel around for a light switch for the desk lamp. The shower head delivered a very weak stream of water and the shower curtain was broken on the shower head side of the tub, so water all over the floor. The only reason I gave the staff a good rating is because of the one guy, the van driver who was wearing a cap with the word ""Security"" on it, was nice and kind and helpful.

"This was a terrible experience to me. First of all I booked my one night stay at this hotel since it was showing competitive prices at the Expedia website, fool of me to pick it just for 10 bucks difference, at the end when I arrived at the hotel I had a terrible surprise to pay, as the lobby assistant told me, a mandatory 25 dollars charge for resort usage fee and 20 dollars for self parking fee. For 45 dollars more I would have gone a totally better hotel than this. The building is old, it is an open type facility like a motel kinda thing, see pictures of the hotel before you book, and the worst part, the walls are so thing that you can hear everything from room to room, I went to sleep at 2 am from the noise being made either at the next room or the room on top of me. I called many times to the lobby and asked them to do something about it, but they didn't. Terrible experience, over priced and couldn't sleep at all.

"The location was okay but we had a huge issue with our AC and we checked in at 6:15 at night and immediately called to let them know our AC wasn't working, the room was 90 degrees. They sent a service man to assist and he said he reset it and it would take an hour but it would start cooling off. It did cool off for about 15mins and then it stopped working again. We kept calling to the front desk and they said someone would come up but then we would receive a call 15 mins later to make sure we were happy with the new AC. I would tell them no one has been back to the room and it still wasn't working so they would apologize and say we will add a ticket in. This happened 3 times before a different engineer came. He was absolutely amazing and he said he had already replaced 4 AC's that day. He worked on it for quite a while and then called the front desk to let them know they really needed to find us another room because this unit didn't work and he had already replaced 4 AC's today and he didn't have anymore left. They said they were full so he needed to try and figure something out. The poor guy literally went to the engineering shop and pieced together 4 different units to try in the room. After every one he would call the desk and say it was sweltering in our room and they needed to find us another room. However they kept claiming there was no other room.

"This is the second time we've stayed at this property. We like the convenient location near I-Drive which is walkable. The one thing that we didn't care for on this visit was the lack of umbrellas at the pools. There were maybe 4 umbrellas total surrounding two pools. The first time we were here, there was an umbrella for ever four lounge chairs. This being summer and over 90 degrees on any given day, a little shade is necessary. It was so hot we couldn't stay at the pool for more than an hour as we had nowhere to retreat from the sun. Also, the pool towels were lacking as well. In two days we had to ask for the towels to be replenished and on Sunday the pool attendant said we would have to wait an hour for towels and that we should go back to our room and take our room towels to use that day. The lack of people at the pool would probably be an indication that the abscense of shade and towels was an issue for others as well. We come to Florida to spend time at the pool and to not be able to do what we love to do on vacation will certainly come into play when we schedule our next visit.

The staff are amazing Anyka on reception especially who assisted no end and made it possible to upgrade to a premium room due to being there celebrating my birthday and being a member of the armed forces as it happened to be memorial weekend at the time, and this just enhanced the experience from start to finish. Sarah who works in both bars again is excellent, friendly and taking the time to speak to customers and ensuring they are looked after at all times whether it be in the hotel bar or the restaurant bar, a friendly face goes no end when people go out of their way to look after guests. The room service was excellent and done to a high standard every day and were always polite and helpful if needed for fresh towels, water etc. I’ve seen some negative reviews for this hotel which I think are unjust, for the price of the rooms in the location that it is, is excellent value for money, so much so I decided to stay for an extra two days at the end of my trip.

"As an Australian family with two children (5&7yrs) on holiday in the US, visiting Disneyland & California Adventure Park for four days, we loved staying at Wyndham Garden Hotel. See our positive comments below:  The hotel was close enough for a 7-8 minute direct walk to the outer security point of the parks, we visited either once or twice a day (with a break in afternoon), we did not feel unsafe and even after the 9pm World of Light show or 9:30pm fireworks, there were still lots of people/families walking back along with us  The staff at the hotel were genuinely friendly, helpful, the rooms were clean, our kids loved the two outdoor pools (luke warm & warm temperature which was great!) during our break from the parks in the mid-afternoon and we looooved the latte coffees from the cafe in the lobby area!! (A big plus for parents each morning!)   A huge plus were the surrounding businesses: - Two supermarkets/pharmacies with everything you’d want, 30 second walk  - Blaze Pizza across the road, with good sized wood fired pizzas with sauce, cheese and two toppings (we went Hawaiian) for $9.99 enough for an adult and our two kids only just finished one between them, awesome pizzas, crusts, staff were busy but happy, a really good relaxing dine in after a long flight/day in the park, went there twice in four nights - The Panda Chinese Restaurant in the row of shops adjacent to the hotel, 30 second walk, with really good (really large) Sweet & Sour Chicken, large fried ri      ",20/05/2019,Western Australia,australian famili two children 57yr holiday us visit disneyland california adventur park four day love stay wyndham garden hotel see posit comment hotel close enough 78 minut direct walk outer secur point park visit either twice day break afternoon feel unsaf even 9pm world light show 930pm firework still lot peoplefamili walk back along us staff hotel genuin friendli help room clean kid love two outdoor pool luke warm warm temperatur great break park midafternoon loooov latt coffe cafe lobbi area big plu parent morn huge plu surround busi two supermarketspharmaci everyth ’ want 30 second walk blaze pizza across road good size wood fire pizza sauc chees two top went hawaiian 999 enough adult two kid finish one awesom pizza crust staff busi happi realli good relax dine long flightday park went twice four night panda chines restaur row shop adjac hotel 30 second walk realli good realli larg sweet sour chicken larg fri ri,0.9899,Positive

"I think calling it a resort is misleading. I associate resorts with lots of amenities, mostly golf, somewhat secluded. This is definitely near things--approximately two miles from Universal Studios amusement park, within walking distance of Icon Park. There was a pool. But think of it as a little more than an upmarket motel, and instead of the front door leading outside, it had a corridor and room service. Every room had a small balcony. Some rooms are definitely louder than others (if you didn't get a poolside room, you have the noise of Icon Park, the noise of the parking lot, or the noise of Universal Boulevard to look forward to. None of the buildings are particularly well marked-- if you tell me I'm in building 9, the building number itself is easily obscured, and the signs in the hallway might suggest that a room number beginning with 10 is in that building (it's not). No elevators, odd numbered rooms are on the top floor of a two story building, so pack lightly or ask for help getting your stuff to your room. Good wi-fi, ok television channel selections, and close to highway on/off ramps to get places. Resort fee included shuttle to Universal Studios-- but only twice in the mornings, and maybe 3 times approximately 8 hours later (the 2 mile walk back has sidewalks the entire way).

"Had a very pleasant stay. Have stayed before and like this hotel due to location, good security, and the restaurant attached. “Tick Tock” is 24/7 and does some really nice meals for those times when you just want to eat local for breakfast or any other time. I did not use bar or sports facilities. Internet was good and international phone calls are free as part of the additional resort charges. Staff were helpful and there is a good left luggage service for the day you leave. 5 dollars per bag and then you free to do a further explore. We left bags and then went to Central Park for a few hours until departure time. We had a room that was billed as 2 double beds. There was 3 of us and taking this room option over 2 separate rooms saved us about £1000 which is a big chunk of spending money. Only real downside was the mattress sagged towards the middle. I imagine the rooms are used as upgraded twins the majority of the time. This meant you gravitated to the centre. As a single it was fine, but struggled as a double. Shower, coffee making facilities, fridge and so on in the room were fine. Cleanliness very good. So apart from a slightly saggy mattress this hotel ticked all the boxes for us. Would recommend for any family group, or lads away weekend. Great Irish bar across street and round corner “Jack Doyles”, 35th....and Pig & Whistle on next street 36th.

"Check in was a big fail - a sign of things to come. We had specifically booked a ""deluxe king room with balcony"" which in the expedia description specifies it has a bathtub/shower combination. First, the guy at reception tries to upsell us on an upgraded room that has no balcony but does have a set of bunk beds in the room - why on earth would a couple want to pay more to have less ie no balcony? and why would we want to pay more to have a set of bunk beds that we are not going to use?! When we got to our room and realised there was no bathtub (even though we had verified it with the receptionist) we called the guest services line and an unenthusiastic voice told us to come back down and tell reception. No 'sorry about that' or 'we will be glad to help you!'. The second receptionist guy basically said the expedia descriptor was false - they don't have any rooms like that - and blamed his reservation colleagues saying there was nothing he could do. And on it went...  This hotel nickel and dimes you for everything - even when things don't cost you money they cost you in stress and make it difficult for you to just enjoy and relax. For example, nice pool area but why do you treat hotel guests as towel-stealing criminals before they have even entered the pool?! You have to sign out your towels - number of towels, room and name - and god forbid you don't return one, they will hunt you down!!

"Negative - I choice this hotel and paid more to stay here because it had the valet parking that several others in the area did not have. There was another hotel with limited hotel parking that was less and we chose not to stay there because we know how the parking in NY can be. Yet, on the 2nd night we arrived back at 4AM from being out with my family and was told that the valet was full. This was absolutely ridiculous. My husband then had to park over two blocks away on the street. If we wanted street parking there were many other hotels that were less expensive where we could have stayed. What also makes matters worst is I called this hotel before book to confirm the valet parking and they did not mention that it's limited valet.

So nothing was wrong with the property itself it was very luxurious and well kept. Cleanliness was also a plus. This staff however was very incompetent and rude. I couldn’t even pay a fee to check in early because the girl at the counter said she had to call a manager to see if any rooms are ready. Honestly I feel like she just didn’t want to deal with me or the 5 other people kept waiting because there was an elderly couple that checked in right before me & they got a room. Everyone else was forced to wait for 3pm. She didn’t call a manager. She was on her phone texting. And while she was checking in the elderly couple she answered her personal phone to chat. Talk about unprofessional! Same thing happened at check out. I only needed the room for a few hours to get some sleep so I didn’t even stay the whole night. I’m waiting at the counter for at least 5-10 minutes before someone assisted me now mind you there are 2 girls at the counter this time around and no line. I was the only one in the lobby! One was actually on the phone with a customer so she obviously couldn’t help me. Fine. The other one was texting on her phone & completely ignoring me! I was really unsatisfied with the staff.

At first the man was very haughty and told me they did not have the room type we ordered and paid for, even without an apology for this situation. So I request for a partial refund, he refused and said that we had booked room via Expedia, we should ask for refund or compensation from Expedia not the Hotel directly. I was cross and continued to explain to this guy that the bunker bed was what we had promised to our daughter and now my daughter was so frustrated up there. Maybe due to my persistence, he at last told me that there was only and the last such room as I had booked. Since the guest hadn’t showed up yet, he agreed to change us to that room. And at 3:00 we finally moved to the room with a bunker. But the experience we had undergone was so unhappy.

"In my opinion, it’s unacceptable for a hotel to not have your room ready at the 4pm check in time. I arrived at 3:55pm, had plans for my family to shower after traveling there and then leave at 5:30pm to get to an engagement at 6pm. I had to complain at 4:45pm and then only did I get a room.   Secondly, I called at 8am to speak to the concierge and ticket agent about theme park discount tickets for the next day. I specifically said we would be there for one day and wanted to visit one park. I asked if there were discounts to purchasing through the ticket agent at the hotel and the agent said yes, up to 50% discount, but only after I checked in. I said ok and waited to purchase my tickets and thereby waited to select fast pass options. Upon arrrival to the hotel, I found out there was no discount for one day tickets AND with the agents “convenience fee”, tickets were MORE expensive than me purchasing them myself online. I’d appreciate honesty from my morning phone call instead of duplicity.   On a bright note, the room was clean. Because of the above two experiences, I would never stay there again. 4pm check in should mean 4pm check in, especially after spending roughly $200+ for a room for the night.

"Would not stay here again! Been to the Disney Springs area many times, but my favourite hotels were fully booked. Decided to give Wyndham a go for one night before flying home to the U.K... I was not put in the main tower of the hotel, and if I had been I’m sure my experience would have been different. I was given a room in one of the courtyard type buildings connected to the hotel, which look more like a motel. I was on the ground floor, facing the car park. It was very noisy well into the night, with cars pulling up outside my room until around 1.30am and some honking their horns. After finally getting to sleep, I was then awoken early by all the delivery trucks pulling into the car park. To top it off, room service were knocking on my door before 9am to see if I’d checked out so they could turn my room over. Certainly not a relaxing experience before a long haul flight home. Would not reccoment to anyone visiting the Disney area, there are much nicer hotels with more modern facilities - this hotel felt very run down in the courtyard area, can’t speak for tower rooms.

Perfect for our 5 year old. The room was an average size, liked that the bathroom had a sliding door so you could be quiet in the morning.

"We stayed here for 1 night before heading out of San Jose airport. The hotel offers a shuttle to and from the, 5 miles away, airport. Jordan helped us on our arrival and was fairly indifferent, bordering on rude. Upon our return to the San Jose Airport, we followed their instructions to call for a shuddle when we were ready - that was at 6:05pm. After about 30 minutes of waiting, we called the front desk who told us they’d call the driver to find out where he was. After another 10 minutes we called again and they said he was on his way. Long story short, he arrived at the airport at 7:02pm (in the hour we sat there waiting we saw all the other airport shuttles come by 3-4 times so I’d definitely recommend any other hotel). When we talked to the driver he told us he was on his lunch break. We talked to Jordan at the front desk about our frustration and he was short, rude, and seemed like he could really care less. When we asked why it took so long he said he didn’t know the driver was on his lunch break, I asked why he didn’t know and he said because he was also on break. I guess my frustration lies in the fact that every other business functions while employees are on breaks, but apparently this hotel shuts down while the employees take their breaks. The room was overpriced and for the price to leave your car overnight, you would hope they could get you a shuddle after a long day of travel in less than an hour.

"Stayed at this hotel for the location. Room was small but it's NYC so that was suspected. For the most part clean did see noticable mold in shower and visible dust/dirt in the vents. However had a nice time. Staff was friendly except for the Wyndham desk people who quickly reminded me of the people at all the tourist traps in the city trying to sucker you in for a deal that's not really a deal. Needed directions to the bathroom in the lobby after pre registration and the woman ignores my question while my son is getting ready to pee his pants and insteads tries to sell me tourist packages. Skip the free gift that is stated on tour room keep. It's not worth the hassle. After waiting and watching her struggle over her sales pitch, I got my NYer attitude on and walked away from her. Found the info desk and they were very helpful and got a key for the bathroom immediately. Felt safe and secure in the hotel at all times. They had an employee checking keys to make sure the right people are in the hotel. Strongly recommend the diner attached to the hotel. Quick food and friendly service. Perfect location for events at MSG. We were there for a Rangers game. Subway is right outside and just up a couple blocks is times square, around the corner is Macy's and a small jaunt is Rockefeller Center. Subway takes you right to World Trade Center and a 10 minute walk from there is Statue of Liberty. Good location to get around.

"I loved the place, very beautiful and the staff was super polite and nice. But the floors of the room was very dirty and since we were traveling with our puppy, we couldn't let them do a proper cleaning to the room but the floor when we first got to the hotel was really dirty. The 2nd thing we didnt like was that my booking said break fast included but if you are booking a room for 3 in which includeds a child, it does not make sence that the hotel gives you one free breakfast passed that covers the meal of the 2 adult but not childs, making you pay $9 plus tax for the childs break fast. We dislike this very much. The 3rd thing we did not like was that on check out day, one lady (staff) that was checking the rooms knocked on out room at 8:00 am to remind us that check out time was at 11:00 am of that same day. We think that knocked was un necessary and very inconsiderate from their part to wake up someone that early just for a reminder like if we didnt know or like if we were passed our check out time.

"We were disappointed in several aspects of our stay. First, we arrived several hours before check in and wanted to leave our luggage while we explored the city. We've done this several times at all other properties we've stayed in (In New York City, Chicago, etc). Here we were advised that we could leave our luggage in an open room off the lobby, but it would not be secure. They do not/can not tag and store luggage in a secure spot. While we were deciding what to do a hostess offered us coffee and directed us to the cream and sugar. We accepted the offer, poured a cup of coffee and shortly thereafter we were presented with a bill for nearly $8.00 for what we thought was complimentary coffee for guests. The room itself was clean and nice, no problems there. A sign on the door in the room says check out time was noon. As our flight didn't leave until 5pm we asked if there was any chance for late check out. We were advised that check out was 11am (although sign in room said noon???) and we would be charged $60 for late check out (again, they cannot securely store bags before or after check out). We decided to go for a bite to eat and when we returned at 10:20am our room keys had already been deactivated (which we didn't discover until we were at our room on the 14th floor).

"I had booked a king room. I get there & they have some excuse why they didn’t have king room. They put me in a family room with smaller beds & bunkbeds. Just one night, cleaning up after a trade show. Amalya at the desk charged me $60 for checking out at 1 pm or 11 am. She doesn’t smile, treats you as if she’s doing me a favor. Plus she kept me waiting for 5 minutes doing who knows what on her computer. Hotel cannot come through on king bed but has to abide by random 2 hour late checkout. Makes me notice the problems with the room. It was actually fairly clean but shower tray built into wall to hold shampoo hits you when you stand in shower under rainfall. It’s uncomfortable. And they give you shampoo sufficient for one, crazy for a “family” room. Left a privacy sign on door during my extra 2 hours & sure enough, housekeeping entered my room. Apparently, Amalya, who said she’d let housekeeping know, never told her. I would’ve given them a 4 but for Amalya. It’s close to Javits but there are 3 more hotels 1 block away.

"When I arrived, the room I was given wasn't the room type I had requested on Hotels.com. I went back down to the front desk and was then given the correct room type.  The room was great overall. Excellent modern decor with bed, desk, bathroom, fridge. Lots of floor space (which is sometimes hard to tell from online photos). The shower was excellent but used a TON of water. The in-room thermostat worked great for being there in the winter.   I have one privacy complaint. Out the window is another hotel or apartment currently being furnished. Their staff were going into rooms that didn't have blinds. The blinds in my bathroom were a bit crumpled, so I felt a little, well, exposed. It also seemed weird to have Venetian blinds in the bathroom (including IN the shower). They may have been in the middle of getting new blinds.  As for the morning: I had also assumed breakfast was part of my stay. The buffet was $20. That's expensive, but not unheard of. But the seating/dining expectations in the restaurant were unclear. It seemed like a self-seating restaurant, and the buffet was laid out for self-serve. When I asked the waitstaff, though, they assigned me a specific table and seemed slightly offended when I had gotten up to get my own coffee. With better signs I may have been a better customer.  This was my first time in New York City. Had a blast and was thankful to stay at a hip hotel like Tryp.

"This property is excellent for its location. It is across the street from Penn Station and Madison Square Garden and only a 5 minute walk from Empire State Building, Macy’s and Times Square. The Tick Tock diner is excellent for breakfast every morning and very popular. However, the price that you are quoted online before you go will not be the same price when you leave. As with a lot of U.S. hotels, there are local taxes and charges applied when booking out. There’s also a $29 charge a night facility fee. When I queried this, I was told it was for use of hotel facilities such as the gym, business Centre and WiFi. I have an issue with paying for facilities that I did not use. Also, when we were given the WiFi details, it pops up on your phone as ‘high speed FREE WiFi’. Obviously not. Also if you arrive before your check in time, expect to pay $5 per bag to put bags aside if you want to walk around while waiting to check in. I have stayed in the New Yorker many times in the last 10 years and I cannot fault it for its location and safety and security but there are a lot of hidden extras and charges when checking in and out.

"Our stay here was generally a pleasant one. The king room we reserved was not available at check-in and we were given queen room for the first night, which, in addition to being much smaller, also had a broken closet door, leaking shower fixtures and a lingering smell of cigarette smoke, despite the property being advertised as smoke-free. Thankfully, when we spoke to Amalia at the front desk the next morning, she was very helpful and had us moved to the king room we had reserved. I very much appreciate her help and dedication to customer service.  I cannot say the same for Orbitz. After speaking to two customer service reps, who offered me coupons for future stays but were not authorized to issue a refund, I spoke with a manager who explained there was nothing he could do, because Orbitz's terms of service permit them to give you a different, less expensive room than what you paid for, and there is nothing you can do about it. That right: I paid for a king room, they gave me a much smaller queen room, and then refused to refund the difference. The CSRs I spoke with at least tried to help; the manager clearly did not care whether I got what I paid the company for or not. I've been using Orbitz for over 10 years and have had mostly positive experiences, but they completely dropped the ball this time, and I'm not sure whether I will use them again.

"Great location. You really can’t beat it. You can easily walk to Disney Springs, and there were buses to the parks. This was the reason for our visit so it worked out well.   The room itself was dated and had a funny chemical smell like it may have previously been a smoking room a long time ago and the carpets had been cleaned many times to try to get the smell out. Beds were clean. Bathroom was not, the toilet was dirty when we arrived.   The pool area was fun, but difficult to access. It took us a while to figure out how to get out there because of lack of signs and it seamed like you had to go out a service area to get to the pool area. No grand entrance and just a little confusing. But once on the pool deck there were things for the kids to do and a nice big pool and hot tub.   The lobby area is nice and updated. There was a bar, breakfast and ice cram area. Staff was friendly and check in was fast and efficient, however the woman working at the desk that checked us in could not clearly explain in English how to get to our room and drew circles all over the hotel map, which also didn’t help. We found our room on our own following general signs, but she easily I could have said “pass the elevators and to your left, outside”. Again, just a little confusing for a first time guest.

"This is a motel is really a 1-2 star. It's very old and worn. I was very surprised that it's a Wyndham Garden and surprised that it was a motel (not a hotel). I felt mislead by Orbitz's rating of it. There is a free shuttle to the airport, which is about 10 minutes away. That's the best thing to say about it.   The negatives -- most of the hotel front desk staff were gruff and not very helpful. There's not free breakfast, which I would expect from this type of hotel. The room itself was old with peeling paint and cheap furniture. It is an old motel and there could be the potential for it to be really cool -- there's a little golf putting green and a pool -- but it's not be kept up or refurbished in a nice way.

"Beware!! We stayed at the Wyndham for a work stay. The first night was just ok but i woke up with a horrible back issue. When i arose from the bed you could hear the springs pop. Left for work and put the Service room card on the door. When we returned we noticed that a spot that was on the sheets was there again. I also sleep with earplugs in my ears and when we noticed the spot i pulled back the sheets and found my earplugs in the bed which told me that the sheets were not changed. When i called down to the front desk, Jordan answered the phone. I asked if servicing the room and not changing the sheets was customary he asked if i wanted housekeeping to come up to change the sheets and i replied that i wanted to know why it wasnt done in the first place to which he replied ""i have no idea i dont work in housekeeping"" He was rude and snarky and in no way tried to calm the situation. Housekeeping came up and called the keeper from the a.m to tell her what happened at which time i told her i had pictures which killed the convo.

"Clean, quite and kid friendly. Nice hot tub, work out room and heated pool. Courteous staff- always had genuine smiles and were ready to help. 4 blocks to Disney entrance- easy walk and totally worth it. We had relatives staying at hotels closer to Disney- they paid more for noisy, old rooms. We ate dinner at House of Blues located in the Garden Walk (open mall) next to this hotel- it had great atmosphere and service. My 7 year old enjoyed playing at Billy Beez (indoor play area) next to House of Blues. We ate breakfast at the IHop across from Disney- it was $86 for two kids meals, plain pancakes and a basic egg dish- no drinks! The next morning we ate at Mimi's Cafe just a couple more blocks down and it was great- affordable and yummy. You can get 4 of their amazing muffins to go for $8! When you enter Disney stay to the left- you will be tempted to go to the first line you see- don't. They all go to the same spot. Over ride your instincts and go to the lines all the way to the left.

I don't know if this is common now or not - I've never come across it - but don't understand the logic.

Booked for a family weekend getaway to Disney World. Gave us a room on the 5th floor. Parking $20 per night. We got in about 8:30pm so after bringing luggage upstairs sent kids to get showers. Shower does not have hot water even though sink does. Took 7 tries to get registration to answer the phone and says no other rooms are available but will send up maintenance. Maintenance works for 24 minutes and gets water to slightly warm after water has been running for about 45 minutes. Go to parks early for magic hours and registration did not give the necessary “blue card” verification so we have to go to guest relations and end up missing magic hours.

"I booked this hotel 4 months prior to my stay booked a balcony with a view. I also called to make sure staff received the reservation and my request for a view of the lake, called again 3 days prior my stay to confirm my request and all was great according to the staff. I have a baby and we were anticipating the view of fireworks on New Year’s Eve from the balcony of the hotel.  Well to my surprise when we checked in we received the complete opposite of what we booked. Unhappy about the situation I agreed to wait for a different room. Waited 3 hrs, received a new room worse than the first. By then it was almost 9pm when we received the keys to the 3er room this one they called it an upgraded but off course still not what I asked for. We were so tired of waiting and frustrated we took the room, only to find a clogged toilet. I ended up dealing with it because by then it was new year.  The next day we checked out and moved to Disney property.  This hotel is nice but if you are going to spend this much money for a room stay at Disney you will not be disappointed. The food at this hotel is soo over priced $80 for cheese burger for 3 don’t do it!  Also very miss leading information and the view of fireworks is very disappointing. Parking cost more than Disney. Between the price for the night food and parking we spent at this hotel more than we actually spent in Disney with a dinnig plan included.

"My family and I were in Orlando visiting family and enjoying nearby attractions and theme parks. After a long day out and about, we were hoping to pull into an easily accessible parking space near our hotel room. Unfortunately this was not the case. Each evening we returned to the property, we had to double park the car and carry our sleeping children inside. After which we then had to come back out and look for parking a few buildings down and walk back to our room. Wyndham Orlando Resort should allocate at least one parking space per room, clearly labeled and conveniently located.  During our stay, the cable also went out for at least 2-days. While the staff acknowledged the matter was being looked into and confirmed technicians were on-site, nothing additional was done. No one was able to provide an ETA for when the services would be restored nor did the staff offer other ways for our family to keep ourselves entertained while in our rooms (e.g. portable DVD player, board games, arts & crafts).  Last but not least, the housekeeping staff failed to replenish our towels on two occasions. The first time we let it go, and made due with what we had. However, on the 2nd incident we had to reach out and ask for towels to be delivered to the room.  While the property itself was in a prime location for our purposes, we unfortunately will not be returning.

"I really enjoyed the fact that this property was right in the heart of International Drive. However, the property is not what it seems. While staying there, the cable was out. When contacting the front desk, you have to call multiple times for someone to pick up. The property sits in the open, seeing as it is made up of multiple buildings. There is no elevator, so if you are on the second floor of the building, you must carry your bags up to two-theee flights of stairs. It is loud, the doors, rooms and property is outdated. Doors continuously slam all night, the walls are thin to the point where you can hear into your neighbors room. There is no security on the property so since the gates do not lock and are not controlled accessed, anyone can walk up to your room door.

Daily housekeeping was dreadful, the same dirty pillow cases were just turned over every day, the duvets supplied were dirty, we were told we'd been ""upgraded"" to a King bed deluxe, which is even more alarming considering the size of the room was half that advertised of a Queen bed deluxe room. The room had a door leading to the next room in the room despite this apparently only being available ""if asked for"", you could hear everything the other guests were saying, even if a cough as the room is so small and walls are so thin the bed is right by the other guest's door. The waiter monitoring breakfast was incredibly rude and aggressive; especially if he feels you aren't going to tip him what he wants. The only good thing about the hotel was the location, but I'm sure you could get another hotel for the same price and the same distance to the main ""times square"", (probably can get one right by ""times square"") which actually gives you the value of the money you paid and service advertised/ entitled to for a 4.5* hotel.

The AC in our room is intentionally locked and could not be turned on until the mechanic came by. The fire alarm beeped all through the night for low battery.

There was peeling paint, dirty walls and carpet and a horrible smell. The room was even worse. The carpet did not feel clean, the walls were dingy, the bathroom was not clean. The mattress looked old and outdated. During our stay the hot water stopped working multiple times and required us to call several times. Only once did maintenance show up.  The lobby staff was not helpful, were always mad and very unfriendly. My daughter is on crutches and we asked to use the lobby restroom. There weas only an escalator and they did not have an accessible means to reach the restroom. The security staff was unhelpful and they thought we may be able to use the service elevator.

"The hotel staff were really friendly. The Lobby was clean, as were the elevators and hallways. The room was clean but calling it a room seems a stretch. An oversized closet would be a more appropriate description. The entry door swing came within inches of the back of the room. Of all the places I've traveled I've never stayed in a closet. Even more annoying than the tiny room was the poorly hung shower curtain. The curtain rod was placed to the inside of the tubs edge. So not only are you in a shower about the size of a travel trailer but the curtain touches and sticks to you the entire time. The afternoon of our second day we returned to our closet around 5 only to find that the cleaning service had skipped us. Luckily the cleaning lady was just down the hall so getting fresh towels was easy but it was none the less disappointing. I didn't spend a fortune but I definitely paid more than enough to get a room, not closet and clean towels. Thank goodness I wasn't there to spend much time in the room. The area around the hotel has adequate options for food that are within walking distance. I stress walking because there's little to no parking around the hotel. The hotel offers parking, at $25 per night. I paid it one night but the space I was told to park in took me almost 20 minutes to work into.

Everyone I encountered working was friendly and happy to help, and the bus services to the parks were great and easily on par with the Disney service (which was one of my worries) as long as you don't mind visiting multiple parks on your way to the one you're going to (tip: if you want to go to Epcot, but missed that bus, get the Magic Kingdom one as it drops you at the monorail station for Epcot too, then get a bus to Disney Springs back later as you can walk from the stop to the hotel easily).  For the price and location I was happy to overlook the room location, and if you're going to spend most of your time at the Parks you'll only really be there at night, so it's not as much of an issue as I first expected!

"Check In experience was the worst of any hotel I have ever checked into period, and I stay in at least two hotels per month.  I was very excited to stay here and was left bitterly disappointed by the hotel staff and policies for early check in.  Check in is 3:00pm. I arrived at the hotel at 12:45 pm and asked of the possibility of checking in early, they said yes...for a fee of $50 USD. They went on say I could check in at 2:00 pm at no charge. So for 1hr 15mins they wanted to charge me $50 USD for a room that is already costing $390 USD per night! When I said no thank you to spending the extra money I asked what would happen to the room only to be told it would remain empty. Rather that give top class customer service to a potential repeat customer they chose instead to taint the experience to the point nor I or anyone in my family will every stay at Tryp again.

I called from the phone in our room only to get the busy signal (tried for about 20-30 minutes). Upon check out I verified again that everything was taken care of and they assured me it was. No receipt offered. I checked my bank account again and found they deducted almost another $50 from my bank account only to be told by staff twice that everything was paid. When I called they said that was for parking, resort fees and tax. They would only refund the resort fee and taxes but not the parking in 7 to 10 days.

However, if I hadn’t been so tired I would have switched hotels, due to the lack of sleep we all got staying here. I was kind of surprised they would allow such a loud party with music to go on so late in their main facility being that rooms are so close to it.

"Initially enjoyed the experience. Problems appeared with the room late in the night as Inwas in the bar for a few hours prior and had only stopped to drop off my bags with my wife before heading down to enjoy martinis.  When getting back upstairs I noticed it was pretty cold in the room. To correct this I turned on the heat a bit higher, as the night went on the room became colder, attempted to walk down to the lobby but saw it was empty for more than 5 min, went upstairs to figure it out on my own. Long story short, the room got to 58 degrees before someone allowed me to start the process of changing rooms around 2am. Originally the issue was that there wasn’t enough staff to help me, the person on the phone finally came up with enough complaining.  I got to another room that was 78 degrees after being in a room that was almost 55 degrees. Once the staff member entered the room they were surprised it was in fact broken. My night and morning were spent dealing with this, preventing me from getting anything done, I ended up fighting the clock to get my work done before check out, when checking out, I tried to communicate my night to the staff member who was actively avoiding that convo as she never even asked how my night was.

The hotel is really rundown. I had to switch rooms twice because of maintenance problems. After checking in I was directed to a customer service desk to receive my welcome gift. Thinking it was a bottle of water it was instead an offer to listen to a sales pitch of one of their properties. But the offer was only for singles so I’d have to remove my wedding ring. I was traveling alone at the time. They also charge a resort fee which includes transportation to the parks. Coming back from the Magic Kingdom it took the bus 50 minutes to make a 2 mile trip.

"Third time at the Wyndham, great hotel for what we wanted for our stay, but the resort charges and credit card holds are quite frankly off putting: Resort tax of $24 per day is quite frankly daylight robbery and merely covers the items that any hotel should cover anyway, we never had daily bottled water which in the tax. As for the credit card holds, the minute you check in they hold the amount of your stay straight away, plus they want another $40 a day security !!!!, apparently we should feel honoured that they only held one payment of $40 for our 7 day stay. I can only assume that the Wyndham Orlando has had a number of guests who have not settled bills historically, but treating every guest as a non paying risk is quite frankly insulting. My son still had a $400 hold on card three days after check out, he had to contact the reception at Wyndham Orlando from the UK by phone in order to resolve the matter, we had checked out with nothing to bill and no outstanding charges.

The TRYP hotel was very disappointing. The lobby felt like a dormitory or a McDonalds. No place to sit. Room was dimly lit and decor strange but not at all in a cool old way. No place to put suitcases so they were on the beds. Housekeeping did not come until we called twice. Someone finally cleaned room around 5:30 pm. The pillows felt like someone had stuffed them with socks as they were very lumpy and very small. Coffee machine in room never worked. Somehow in this day and age they managed to find a TV without HD so picture quality was very poor. Towels were so scratchy they felt like sandpaper. It was a hard rain one morning but of course the hotel did nothing to offer umbrellas for their guests to use. Never ate anything there - can only imagine the food would be subpar.

Stayed here for 3 nights. Room was ok. The nicest and newest thing in the room was the TV. The drawers on the dresser would not stay closed....push them shut and within seconds they would slide open...all by themselves!! The bed was ok...hard and firm but tons of pillows. HUGE GAP under the door that lets a nice chilly breeze into the room. Tons of lights inside and outside of the room. If you need it to be dark to sleep then bring some sunglasses cause the window shades do not close all the way and the curtains are to short! I would not choose to stay at this place again for what i paid per night but it served its purpose and i survived. UBER picks up from here and was awesome.

"The room did not meet the expectations from the listing there was no coffee maker, though one was listed on the amenities. We asked for a coffee maker to be brought to our room after we checked in and by the end of our stay, none had arrived. We had to pay for our bags to be held after checkout, which in itself is ridiculous, and when we returned to retrieve them they told us what we paid was only half, the second half was required to take our bags. The bellman didn't accept credit card or allow us to charge the amount to our room. It was the end of our trip, and we weren't expecting to need more cash so we'd used our remainder to give our uber driver an excellent cash tip on the way back to the hotel. Had we known about the additional fee, we would have tipped using the app and saved the cash for this payment! Instead, we had to leave the hotel to go find an ATM, when we were already running late for the airport due to unexpected traffic delays. We had to go back into the storage unit to help the bellman find our bags because there was no organizational system! They were on an entirely different shelf from where he was looking! We wasted 45 minutes on this process when you consider that we had to wait in line for the bellman twice as he retrieved bags for other guests one at a time. We missed our flight by 3 minutes, as a result, which cost us hundreds of dollars! Additionally, the room was underwhelming. Only the lobby is luxurious, save your money.

When we got there and two days after housekeeping cleaned the room, there was no soap for the shower, only a half roll of bathroom tissue, and no closet in the room. Also, there is a slab of marble jutting out where your head should be if you are planning on taking a bath.

The hotel is pet friendly apparently. Be warned. There was clearly a pet allowed in the room we were staying in and either the room wasn’t cleaned appropriately or at all or the guest never disclosed the fact that they were bringing in an animal.

"Wyndham Garden San Jose Airport was offering a really good rate compared to the other hotels in the area for the dates that I wanted. I stayed in 2 different rooms during my trip to the area and that probably improved my opinion of this hotel.   I could tell that this was an older property that was probably bought by Wyndham and fixed up a bit. The lobby didn't give me the greatest first impression. The furniture and accent color decor were fine, but I didn't love the low ceiling covered in mirrors.  I walked through the pool area to my courtyard-facing room. The pool area was spotless and the garden looked nice.   My first room (166) was next to the housekeeping office which had its own noise and traffic. The interior of the room had some nice updates like the sink, the bed, and decor, but the painting seemed poorly done. Perhaps this room only had 1 coat of wall paint; it clearly needed another several to hide the scuff marks and stains. The bed was very comfortable.  My second room (190) was also courtyard facing. The wall painting in that room looked much better and it actually made the whole room as a whole look better.   The in-room Wolfgang Puck's coffee was horrible.  I really appreciated the shuttle service. They were fast and the drivers were very courteous. Although the reservation information asked me to call ahead to schedule the shuttle, I was told to call back as soon as I was with my bag and ready for pickup.

"Central location in New York, between two big railway stations, and in a very animated zone, this hotel could benefit more from a friendlier staff.

"This hotel was amazing for our Honeymoon. From check-in to check-out, my husband and I had no complaints. We stayed for a week for our Disneyland adventures and this place was perfect. It's a 15 minute walk to the parks and downtown Disney. We were able to walk back to the hotel for a midday refresher and nap. This helped hugely. There's also a CVS, Walgreens, Starbucks, Pieology, Subway, and several food places within walking distance. The hotel room is equipped with a microwave and fridge, perfect for saving left overs and making quick breakfasts. There's also the Anaheim Garden Walk that has shops, restaurants like the Cheesecake Factory, and Bubba Gump that is literally only a 5 minute walk away. I cannot emphasize how convenient this all was. I would also like to give a huge shout-out to the front desk staff. Wonderful customer service though-out our stay. Their house-keeping also kept our room incredibly fresh and tidy each day. They have several amenities and no hidden resort fees. Outside is a gorgeous heated pool and spa tub that I wish we got more use out of. Lastly, their underground parking garage reassured us that our vehicle was safe and sound.

This place was terrible considering it was a Wyndham property. The room was the size of a postage stamp with barely enough room for the bed. We had booked for 3 days and a flight cancelation caused us to arrive the next day and even though I called the hotel ahead of time not asking for a refund our room was unavailable when we got there. The next day we get back late at approximately 1:30 in the morning and discover we had no housekeeping done that day. So at 1:30 in the morning we have to go down to the front desk to ask for towels and we were told that housekeeping does not clean the room unless it is requested. According to hotels.com this should have been included with the room as I have never heard of a regular hotel making you request housekeeping service. They had water coolers in the lobby and down stairs outside of the breakfast area that were never filled however you could buy a $2 bottle of water from a vending machine that they keep filled. The location of this hotel was also not very convenient if you are going into the city for tourism.

"The New Yorker has a beautiful lobby, central location and friendly staff, but that is where the charm ends. The rooms themselves are old and dingy. The windows really need to be replaced as they let in way too much noise.

The shower was very low, I am 5'5'', so anyone who is taller than that will have to stoop. There are weird stains on the curtains and a very firm old mattress for bed. The rooms are tiny but that would be okay if they weren't so dingy. I think this place survives due to the name, because tourists will flock to it, and the location. Otherwise, it is really not worth the price. The amenities fee is also a rip off, as there are very few amenities. They do not even have coffee in the rooms.

He was unable and we had to wait 20min for someone to drive to the hotel with their master key to re-set the lock. After I ask security why no one has stopped the party, he pounds on the door. The party raged on till past midnight and we were relocated. We never saw the party get stopped. The next day we were locked out of one of the new rooms and informed we were given the wrong keys. They swapped our room keys so each group stayed in rooms, that were in the names of the other. My sister needed to check out a day before me so, it was a long process to get it straightened out.

"I still have mixed feelings about this hotel.  We arrived early on Saturday and were told they would call us when our room was ready -- they NEVER called and we went back around 4 or 5 and tons of people were checking in and going straight to their room. We re-checked in and were given absolutely one of the worst hotel rooms I have EVER been placed in. It was extremely small, around 100sq feet ?? Hot water was not working, old tv on a tiny counter, no room at all for luggage, no refrigerator, no coffee pot, no NOTHING!! Absolutely not worth the price of the room --EVER!! We sent in an online review that night and the manager called our room and told us she would have us switched the next day. However when doing what we were told to do the hotel staff was not aware of the request so that was another ordeal.  We were then told by the staff to come back after 4 and they would have a new room ready for us. We showed up around 4:30 and were told ""we were lucky because they just happened to have 1 room????""  Well, I have a problem with this because we were told we would have a better room but now it was ""just our luck""?? The next room was much better! I do feel sorry for anyone paying the price and getting the room we had to begin with.  Location was a good central location for what we needed.

This resort is broken up into 2 parts. The Wyndham Grand which is the Hotel and the resort which is the Timeshare part where the full suites are. You have access to all of the of the full resort however when it comes to room charges you can only do your room charges on the hotel side. I made that mistake one day during my stay and went to one of the pool bars on the other side of the resort on the timeshare side and tried to charge the drink to my room and they could not find my room number . I had to go back later to bring my payment later in the day. The staff goes out of your way to be kind and helpful and they gave me an upgrade at no charge since it was my birthday and also a late checkout on the day I was checking out as well.

This hotel is well kept and the staff are courteous and professional. The location is great because you have a shopping area and movies right behind in walking distance.

When booking through Expedia, there is no mention of the resort fees and parking fees. Total resort fee was $75 for 4 night stay plus $22.95 per night for parking. There is no other option for parking. My card was charged $375 upon arrival for deposit. 20% was added to room service which is of course pricey. Upon check in we were told our room with one bed was booked, but they had another room with two king size beds. Not a problem, but I want what I paid for.

Although I called for hangers since there were none, they were never delivered so we bought some at the nearby RiteAid. The safe gave us problems and we had to call for service twice (they were prompt in responding for the safe). Although there were four of us, only two towels were provided and after calling three times for additional towels, it took them over a half hour to bring them since ""they were still drying"". After the first day we wanted to check out but thought we were really only there to sleep and even with that thought, I felt even the basic amenities were lacking. Two positives: great water pressure and the beds/pillows were comfy. Staff were friendly but I highly doubt if we will return to this hotel.
